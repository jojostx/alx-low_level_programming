# C Function pointers
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about **function pointers** in **C language**

## Technologies
* C files compiled using `gcc 11.2.0`
* C files written according to C90 standard
* All files written and tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files

All the following are programs written in C language:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | program that prints `nbytes` number of bytes of the opcode of it's main function |
