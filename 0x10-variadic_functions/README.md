# C Variadic functions
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about **variadic functions** in **C language**

## Technologies
* C files compiled using `gcc 11.2.0`
* C files written according to C90 standard
* All files written and tested on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`

## Files

All the following are programs written in C language:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-sum_them_all.c` | File that contains a function that returns the sum of all its parameterse |
| `1-print_numbers.c` | File that contains a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line |
| `2-print_strings.c` | File that contains a function that prints strings, followed by a new line |
| `3-print_all.c` | File that contains a function that prints anythings |
| `variadic_functions.h` | Header file that contains the prototypes of the above functions |
